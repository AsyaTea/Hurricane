# PitStop

Pitstop is an iOS App to track your car's expenses. This project is currently being developed in team with [Ivan Voloshchuk](https://github.com/IV0000), [Francesco Puzone](https://github.com/morbuen) and [Anna Antonova](https://github.com/Oneanya21).

This will allow us to create statistics in real time to make you aware of your spendings throughout the year. Additionally, we have built a **Document** section to let you save your car documents all in one place and, an **Important Numbers** section for saving numbers to reach straight away in case of any unpredictable event occurs.
