# PitStop

PitStop is an iOS App to track your car's expenses. This project is currently being developed in team with [Ivan Voloshchuk](https://github.com/IV0000), [Francesco Puzone](https://github.com/morbuen) and [Anna Antonova](https://github.com/Oneanya21).

## Overview
The first time you download the app, you are invited through the on-boarding to insert your car's data such as brand, model and fuel type.
Everytime you make an expense related to your car you can report it by inserting data through a modal sheet into our App, you can choose between a variety of categories and options, as well as changing the date. This will allow us to create statistics in real time to make you aware of your spendings throughout the year. Additionally, we have built a **Document** section to let you save your car documents all in one place and, an **Important Numbers** section for saving numbers to reach straight away in case of any unpredictable event occurs. 

Do you find annoying have to remember when you need to overhaul the car? Or change the tires? I believe yes, for most of us, that's why we implemented a notification feature...

## Frameworks & Technologies
We used **SwiftUI** to create the user interface, **Swift** as main programming language and **CoreData** to save our user's persistent data.
The design pattern we adopted is **MVVM** with different view models for handling CoreData access, the statistics, categories and fuel type...
